#  Kyrie  #

Kyrie (/ˈkaɪri/) is a scripting engine for the dialogue and text of
  games, visual novels, and the like.
It is written in Literate CoffeeScript, so the source code also serves
  as the documentation.
See the [Sources/](./Sources/) directory for more.

The language used for interfacing with Kyrie is called KyrieScript, and
  it is formally specified in the [Specification/](./Specification/)
  directory.

A demo of Kyrie in action will eventually exist at [Demo/](./Demo/),
  and should be viewable live at <https://go.KIBI.family/Kyrie/Demo/>.
