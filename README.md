#  Kyrie  #

Kyrie is a scripting engine for the dialogue and text of games, visual
  novels, and the like.
It is written in Literate CoffeeScript, so the source code also serves
  as the documentation.
See the [Sources/](./Sources/README.litcoffee) directory for more.

A demo of Kyrie in action will eventually exist at [Demo/](./Demo/),
  and should be viewable live at <https://go.KIBI.family/Kyrie/Demo/>.
